User story 
As a personal assistant to the CEO I want an email template functionality so that 
I can send all sorts of mass/personalized emails with just a couple of mouse-clicks. 

Can you divide the requirement to sub tasks (Donâ€™t think about the UI related sub tasks)


1 eg The system replaces variable placeholders like ${firstname} and ${lastname} from a template with values provided at runtime.

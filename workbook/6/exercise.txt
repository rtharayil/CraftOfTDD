User story 
As a personal assistant to the CEO I want an email template functionality so that 
I can send all sorts of mass/personalized emails with just a couple of mouse-clicks. 

 Requirement to sub tasks 

1	The system replaces variable placeholders like ${firstname} and ${lastname} from a template with values provided at runtime.
2	The system attempts to send a template with some variables not populated will raise an error.
3	The system silently ignores values for variables that arenâ€™t found from the template.

Can you convert this to specification by example?
